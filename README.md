LSGAN (Least Squares GAN) with MNIST
=============

## Model
### Generator:  
> Conv #1: ConvT(nz, 4ngf, 4, 1, 0) → BatchNorm → ReLU  
> Conv #2: ConvT(4ngf, 2ngf, 3, 2, 1) → BatchNorm → ReLU  
> Conv #3: ConvT(2ngf, ngf, 4, 2, 1) → BatchNorm → ReLU  
> Conv #4: ConvT(ngf, nc, 4, 2, 1) → Tanh  
(nz: dimension of latent vector, ngf: # of features of genetator, nc: # of channels)  
  
### Discriminator:  
> Conv #1: Conv(nc, ndf, 4, 2, 1) → LeakyReLU(0.2)  
> Conv #2: Conv(ndf, 2ndf, 4, 2, 1) → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU(0.2)  
> Conv #3: Conv(2ndf, 4ndf, 3, 2, 1) → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU(0.2)  
> Conv #4: Conv(4ndf, 1, 4, 1, 1) → Sigmoid  
(ndf: # of features of discriminator)
